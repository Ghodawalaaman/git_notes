* What I did today?
+ I learned a lot about nvim today. Also learned a little bit of lua. I'm thinking of making my own little init.lua from scratch.
+ I learned about how to highlight text in neovim. Although I don't quite understand it. ðŸ˜…
+ Here is some window split command I learned today
  | Command             | Purpose                                         |
  |---------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
  | :split  <file_name> | To open a file in another window                |
  | :vsplit <file_name> | To open a file in another vertical window       |
  | C-W h,j,k,l         | To move around to different windows             |
  | :only               | To close all the windows except the current one |
  | C-W +               | To increase the size of window                  |
  | C-W -               | To decrease the size of window                  |
  | :vnew               | To open a empty file in vertical split window   |
  | :qall               | To close all the windows                        |
+ The command described above is very usefull when editing multiple files.
+ I'm going to learn more about nvim and emacs.
